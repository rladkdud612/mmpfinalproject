            1. Only 1 out of every 10 dogs born will find a permanent home.<br/><br/>
           2. The main reasons animals are in shelters: owners give them up, or animal control finds them on the street.<br/><br/>
           3. Homeless animals outnumber homeless people 5 to 1.<br/><br/>
           4. Each year, approximately 2.7 million dogs and cats are killed every year because shelters are too full and there aren’t enough adoptive homes. Act as a publicist for your local shelter so pets can find homes. Sign up for Shelter Pet PR.<br/>br/>
           5. Approximately 7.6 million companion animals enter animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.9 million are dogs and 3.4 million are cats.<br/><br/>
           6.  According to the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP), less than 2% of cats and only 15 to 20% of dogs are returned to their owners.
           7. 25% of dogs that enter local shelters are purebred.<br/><br/>
           8. About twice as many animals enter shelters as strays compared to the number that are relinquished by their owners.<br/><br/>
           9. It’s impossible to determine how many stray dogs and cats live in the United States. Estimates for cats alone range up to 70 million.<br/><br/>
           10. Only 10% of the animals received by shelters have been spayed or neutered. Overpopulation, due to owners letting their pets accidentally or intentionally reproduce, sees millions of these “excess” animals killed annually.<br/><br/>
           12. Many strays are lost pets that were not kept properly indoors or provided with identification.<br/><br/> </div>
